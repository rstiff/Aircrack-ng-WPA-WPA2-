WPA/WPA2 networks




WPA/WPA2 networks use pre-shared keys and aircrack-ng can only crack
pre-shared keys. 



what is WPA 


WPA(Wi-Fi protected access) is imporved data encryption compared to WEP.



what is WPA2



WPA2 networks are more secure and are what most people use for there networks as well. WPA2 networks provide stronger data protection and network access control. As well WPA2 supports AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption, wich is more secure tham TKIP.



Equitment used

-> TPLink Router

-> Kali linux

-> wireshark

-> aircrack-ng

-> long range usb adapter
